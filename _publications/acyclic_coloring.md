An acyclic coloring of a graph G is a coloring of the vertices of G, where no two
adjacent vertices of G receive the same color and no cycle of G contains vertices of only two
colors. An acyclic k-coloring of a graph G is an acyclic coloring of G using k colors. In this paper
we show the necessary and sufficient condition of acyclic coloring of a complete k-partite graph.
Then we derive the minimum number of colors for acyclic coloring of such graphs. We also show
that any complete k-partite graph G having n1, n2, ...., nk vertices in its P1, P2, ...., Pk partition
respectively is acyclically (2k −1)-colorable using X

division vertices, where nmax = max(n1, n2, ..., nk). Finally we show that there is an infinite
number of cubic planar graphs which are acyclically 3-colorable.
