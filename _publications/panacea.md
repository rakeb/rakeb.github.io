<p align="justify">
We describe Panacea, a system that supports natural language processing (NLP) components for
active defenses against social engineering attacks.
We deploy a pipeline of human language technology, including Ask and Framing Detection, Named
Entity Recognition, Dialogue Engineering, and Stylometry. Panacea processes modern message formats through a plug-in architecture to accommodate innovative approaches for message analysis,
knowledge representation and dialogue generation.
The novelty of the Panacea system is that uses NLP
for cyber defense and engages the attacker using
bots to elicit evidence to attribute to the attacker
and to waste the attackerâ€™s time and resources.
