Email spear-phishing attack is one of the most devastating cyber threat against individual and business victims. Using spearphishing emails, adversaries can manage to impersonate authoritative
identities in order to incite victims to perform actions that help adversaries to gain financial and/hacking goals. Many of these targeted
spear-phishing can be undetectable based on analyzing emails because,
for example, they can be sent from compromised benign accounts (called
lateral spear-phishing attack).
In this paper, we developed a novel proactive defense technique using
sender email address mutation to protect a group of related users against
lateral spear-phishing. In our approach, we frequently change the sender
email address randomly that can only be verified by trusted peers, without imposing any overhead or restriction on email communication with
external users. Our Email mutation technique is transparent, secure, and
effective because it allows users to use their email as usual, while they
are fully protected from such stealthy spear-phishing.
We present the Email mutation technique (algorithm and protocol) and
develop a formal model to verify its correctness. The processing overhead due to mutation is a few milliseconds, which is negligible with the
prospective of end-to-end email transmission delay. We also describe a
real-world implementation of the Email mutation technique that works
with any email service providers such as Gmail, Apple iCloud, Yahoo
Mail, and seamlessly integrates with standard email clients such as Gmail
web clients (mail.google.com), Microsoft Outlook, and Thunderbird.
