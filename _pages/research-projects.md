My research goal is to develop autonomous resilient systems using cyber deception and moving target defense to detect and mitigate advanced persistent threats (APT), especially malware, spear-phisher, and network reconnaissance attacks. 

My research aims to build intelligent agents that make adaptive, risk-aware, and cost-effective defense decisions autonomously by learning the environment and considering the uncertainty of the attackerâ€™s true strategy while ensuring resiliency and fulfilling of business policy.

For optimal defense action planning and system orchestration, I use discrete optimization (SMT), sequential decision making (MDP/POMDP), reinforcement learning, etc. 

I have hands-on experience building software for diverse fields using the MITRE ATT&CK framework, software-defined networking (SDN), cryptography, email protocols, payment applications, and more.
